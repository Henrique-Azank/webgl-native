Main project TODOS and IDEAS: 

0. Create an initial version of the repository and implement a CI/CD pipeline
for creating the installable version of the native desktop application

1. Implement the Radix component library base components
    1.1 - Implement the storybook for development, prototyping and 
    creating a bespoke design system and component set.
    1.2 - Sepparate the component library into a reusable repository
    for later tauri-desktop app development (common and custom components
    can be used in multiple apps)

2. Create an animated main menu for the application:
    2.1 - Main menu should list all available examples and a short description
    2.2 - Each example in the main menu should render a gif preview 

3. Create the rendered examples: 
    3.1 - Each example should be able to be rendered in full screen 
    3.2 - In conjunction with the example, an explanation as well as the full source code
    (how can I render the source code by referencing the example source code itself ?)

4. Research on how to create a sandbox environment so I can provide a sandbox environment 
for the user to try out its own shaders, objects and scenes. 

5. Use what I learn to develop another version of this repository to test out my 
other data visualization components and the work-related desktop application
