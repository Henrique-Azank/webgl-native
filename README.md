# WebGL native app

[![License: MIT](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-yellow.svg)](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT)

Created this repository as a way to render WebGL and Three.js scenes in a separate environment with access to the user's local file system and other
utilities that a framework like Tauri enables. The intention is to provide a nice environment for testing out 3D-based applications in a 
way that we can leverage both the powerful WebGL API and not to be overly concerned over building requirements for different platforms.
